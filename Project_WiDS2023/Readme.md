# Project_WiDS2023

## Abstract
This project addresses the WiDS 2023 Challenge through the development of **fair and accurate machine learning models**.  
The work includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model selection**, and **performance evaluation**.  
The goal is to achieve reliable predictions while providing transparency into the modeling process.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Normalization / standardization  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creation of new variables from existing ones  
   - Selection of relevant features  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Implemented and compared multiple algorithms:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Random Forest  
     - XGBoost / LightGBM  
   - Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - ROC-AUC Curve  
   - Confusion Matrix  

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved **[X]% accuracy** and **[Y] ROC-AUC**.  
- Feature importance analysis revealed that **[Top Features]** were most influential.  

## Reproducibility
- All experiments are stored in `notebooks/`.  
- Source code is modularized in `src/`.  
- Models and predictions are saved in `outputs/`.  

## Future Work
- Apply deep learning approaches (e.g., Neural Networks).  
- Conduct fairness-aware evaluation (bias detection).  
- Deploy the final model via a web interface.
